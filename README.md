# HP-Elite-Slice-Opencore
My EFI Files for the HP Elite Slice.
Will upload the files soon.


USB Ports are working.
iMessage works.
FaceTime should also work. Can't test it.
Intel Ethernet is working.
Intel Wifi is working.

Some things have to be fixed. Like Bluetooth, CPU Power Management, DRM (but this is a Big Sur bug).
